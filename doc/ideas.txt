Basics:

1. There are two main entities: modules and threads;
2. Module represents immutable code and mutable data;
3. Both code and data of module are persistent;
4. Module has copy UUID (ID) and type UUID (TID);
5. Module can be moved or copied inside it's host or into another host;
6. ID and TID of moved module don't change;
7. ID of module copy is different from original ID;
8. TID of module copy is same as original TID;
9. Module has number of external procedures;
10. External procedure can be called by specifying module ID;
11. External procedure can be locally called by specifying module TID;

Synchronization:

1. There are only synchronous calls;
2. External procedure can be a function, reader or writer. Functions don't
   have access to module mutable data; readers have read access; writers have
   write access;
3. Function calls are never blocked;
4. Reader and writer calls of module are blocked if there is a writer call in
   progress (only a single writer can be called at same time);
5. Writer calls of module are blocked if there are another reader calls in
   progress (several readers can be called at same time, but no writer);
6. Writers have higher unblock priority over readers;

Module freezing:

1. Module can get frozen, i.e., to become inaccessible;
2. Threads executing inside a module are stopped when it becomes frozen;
3. Module can get unfrozen;
4. When module becomes unfrozen stopped threads resume their execution;
5. Copy does not contain stopped threads of original.
